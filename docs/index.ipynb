    "# [`colorcet`](https://github.com/bokeh/colorcet): Perceptually uniform colormaps from CET\n",
    "\n",
    "Peter Kovesi at the Center for Exploration Targeting created a very useful set of [perceptually uniform colormaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03700), many of which can replace the highly non-uniform colormaps provided with Python plotting programs.  Here we will show how to use them via the new [colorcet](https://github.com/bokeh/colorcet) python package, listing all the ones available and allowing you to evaluate how perceptually uniform they are for you, your particular monitor, etc. Download and installation instructions are at the [github site](https://github.com/bokeh/colorcet). Note that this web page is also a [notebook](https://github.com/bokeh/colorcet/blob/master/docs/index.ipynb), if you want to recreate the results yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will plot them using [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) via [holoviews](http://holoviews.org), but identical [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) palettes are also provided, and both Bokeh palettes and Matplotlib colormaps are usable in [datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader).  Thus these colormaps can be used in any of those Python packages, as well as any other package that accepts a Python list of normalized RGB tuples or hex colors.  See \n",
    "[Peter's site](http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/) to download versions for other non-Python packages.\n",
